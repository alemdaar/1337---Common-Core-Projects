# 42 Common Core 📚💻

This repository contains **all the projects I worked on (and will work on)** during the **42 / 1337 Common Core** curriculum. It reflects my progression in **low-level programming, algorithms, graphics, networking, and system concepts**.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Track my learning journey at **42 Network (1337 – Morocco)**
- Centralize all Common Core projects in one place
- Showcase my growth in **C programming and computer science fundamentals**
- Serve as a reference for revision and improvement
